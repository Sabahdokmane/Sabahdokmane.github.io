    <h1>Science of Yoga</h1>
    <p style="padding: 10px;"> is the book I wanted to read when I
        first started practicing yoga. In classes, teachers offer
        (sometimes conflicting) cues and claims—“Calm your
        nervous system by elongating your exhales;” “This
        pose will boost your immunity;” “Align your knee over
        your ankle”—and I constantly wondered, “Why?”
        For the past decade, through workshops, reading
        research papers, and completing my Master of Science
        in yoga therapy at Maryland University of Integrative
        Health, I have continued to fill my notebooks with
        facts, figures, sketches, and stories. Science of Yoga
        summarizes the notes I found most fascinating as a
        yoga student and teacher. This book is intended as
        neither a comprehensive text on human anatomy and
        yoga, nor a medical reference book; it is just the
        beginning.</p>

    <p style="padding: 10px;">
        ; it is just the
        beginning. My intention is for this material to spark
        more curiosity and discussion about the science of
        yoga, and lead to more inspired yoga practitioners and
        professionals, more rigorous research, more public
        policies that encourage yoga in schools and healthcare,
        and, ultimately, more accessibility and acceptance.
        Through my research, scientific principles and
        evidence have demystified so much of the practice.
        Surprisingly, this made my transformative experiences
        feel even more magical. There is just so much more</p>
